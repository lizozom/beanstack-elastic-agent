    "message": "BeanStack Uptown New York is performing exceptionally well because of a **viral TikTok moment** featuring one of their baristas that turned the location into a social media destination throughout 2025.\n\n## Key Success Factors\n\n**Viral Social Media Effect**\n- A barista went viral on TikTok, creating constant foot traffic from influencers, tourists, and people seeking photo opportunities\n- Celebrity sightings became common, with lines wrapping around the block\n- This drove revenue from $827K in Q1 to a sustained $960K in Q2, Q3, and Q4 (hitting the revenue cap)\n\n**Operational Excellence Under Pressure**\n- **Zero staff turnover** all year despite the chaos\u2014all 7 employees stayed through the entire viral phenomenon\n- **Labor costs well-controlled** at 30-33% of revenue, even with massive volume spikes\n- **Inventory waste stayed low** at 3.3-4.1% across all quarters, showing strong inventory management despite unpredictable crowd surges\n- **Customer satisfaction remained solid** at 4.0-4.3 out of 5, even with long lines and constant disruptions\n\n**Strong Product Mix**\n- Top sellers adapted well to seasons: Chai Tea Lattes and Peppermint Mochas in winter, Lavender Lattes and Iced Chai in spring, Cold Brew and Frappuccinos in summer, seasonal lattes in fall\n- The team knew exactly what to stock based on demand patterns\n\nThe branch manager (Brian Ramirez) acknowledges they're \"barely keeping up\" and \"exhausted\" from managing the social media chaos, but the team has held together remarkably well\u2014turning what could have been operational disaster into the chain's top-performing location."
